This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

This app is set up to deploy to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** (one-time): In your repo on GitHub go to **Settings → Pages**. Under "Build and deployment", set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
2. **Push to `main`**: Each push to the `main` branch runs the workflow and deploys the static site.
3. **Your site** will be at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/rigidbodydynamicsai/`

To run the deployment manually, use **Actions → Deploy to GitHub Pages → Run workflow**.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
