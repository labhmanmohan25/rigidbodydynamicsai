The core gap -- no AI system that can auto-generate a complete, multi-department group proposal within minutes -- represents a greenfield opportunity. With 50-70% of RFPs going unanswered and planners choosing based on response speed, an AI-powered RFP response tool that cuts response time from days to minutes could capture significant share of the $8-15B in leaked US hotel revenue alone.
