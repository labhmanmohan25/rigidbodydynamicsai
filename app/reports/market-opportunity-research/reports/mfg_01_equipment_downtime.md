## 1. PROBLEM MARKET SIZE -- Total Annual Cost of Unplanned Downtime

### Global Cost Estimates

| Source | Estimate | Year |
|--------|----------|------|
| Siemens "True Cost of Downtime" report | **$50B/yr** across discrete and process manufacturing | 2023 |
| Aberdeen / Senseye (acquired by Siemens) | **$3.3 million per hour** average across Fortune Global 500 industrial firms; extrapolated to **$864B/yr** across all FG500 firms | 2022-2023 |
| Wall Street Journal / Deloitte analysis | Unplanned downtime costs industrial manufacturers **5-20% of productive capacity** | 2023 |
| ARC Advisory Group | Unplanned downtime in process industries alone costs **$20B+/yr** | 2023 |

The commonly cited **$50B/yr figure** is conservative and typically refers to discrete manufacturing only. When process industries (oil & gas, chemicals, power) are included, the total likely exceeds **$100B/yr**.

### Cost Per Hour of Downtime by Industry

## 5. WHY STILL UNSOLVED -- Barriers to Adoption

### 5a. Sensor Retrofit Cost

- **Cost to retrofit one machine with vibration, temperature, and current sensors:** $2,000 -- $15,000 per asset
- **Typical plant has 200-1,000+ critical assets:** Total retrofit cost of **$500K -- $5M+**
- **Wireless sensor costs have dropped:** From $500+ per sensor node (2018) to **$50-$150** per node (2024), but installation and integration still costly
- **ROI horizon:** 12-24 months, which many CFOs consider too long for uncertain returns

### 5b. Data Integration Complexity

- **Average manufacturing plant runs 5-15 different OT (operational technology) systems** that don't talk to each other
- **Protocols:** OPC-UA, Modbus, PROFINET, EtherNet/IP, MQTT, proprietary -- no single standard dominates
- **IT/OT convergence is the #1 cited challenge** in IIoT adoption (Gartner, 2024)
- **Data quality:** 60-70% of sensor data collected is never analyzed (McKinsey 2024)

### 5c. Legacy PLC/SCADA Systems

- **Average age of PLC/SCADA infrastructure in US manufacturing:** 15-20 years
- **50%+ of installed PLCs** do not support modern communication protocols (Ethernet/IP, OPC-UA)
- **Replacing a legacy PLC system:** $50K-$200K per production line, plus weeks of downtime for cutover
- **"If it ain't broke, don't fix it" culture** deeply embedded in plant operations

### 5d. Workforce & Organizational Barriers

- **Severe shortage of data scientists/ML engineers** willing to work in manufacturing environments
- **Maintenance technicians** average age is 50+ in many plants; digital literacy gap
- **Organizational silos:** Maintenance, operations, and IT departments rarely collaborate effectively
- **Failed pilot projects:** 70-80% of IIoT pilots never scale to production (Cisco/McKinsey)

### 5e. Vendor Landscape Confusion

- Hundreds of vendors with overlapping claims; buyers struggle to evaluate solutions
- Lock-in fears: Proprietary platforms create dependency
- Many solutions require cloud connectivity, which creates cybersecurity concerns for OT networks

## Executive Summary

**The problem is massive and growing.** Unplanned equipment downtime costs global manufacturing a minimum of **$50B/yr** (conservative, discrete manufacturing only) and likely **$100B+/yr** when process industries are included. The automotive sector bears the highest per-hour costs at **$1.3M-$2.0M/hr**, while even lower-cost industries like food processing see **$30K-$137K/hr** in losses.

**The market is underpenetrated.** Despite clear ROI (predictive maintenance reduces downtime by 30-50% and maintenance costs by 25-30% per Deloitte), only **15-25% of manufacturers** use true predictive maintenance, and only **8-12%** leverage AI/ML. The majority (**55-60%**) remain purely reactive.

**The opportunity window is now.** The predictive maintenance software market is growing at **~25-30% CAGR** and will reach **$40-65B by 2030**. Key enablers are falling sensor costs, mature edge AI, and workforce shortages forcing automation. VC investment remains strong at **$2-4B/yr** in the sector, with major industrials (Siemens, Rockwell, Emerson, Fortive, ABB) aggressively acquiring startups.

**The gap remains because of integration, not technology.** The core ML/AI technology exists. The unsolved problems are: (1) retrofitting legacy equipment with sensors cost-effectively, (2) integrating heterogeneous OT protocols, (3) bridging the IT/OT organizational divide, and (4) making solutions accessible to plants without data science teams. **Any startup that solves the "last mile" integration problem at low cost has a massive addressable market.**
